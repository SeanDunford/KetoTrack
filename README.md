The trifecta is finally working together. 
Adam/Matt/Sean working on Getting Gainz. 


- Installing React Native 
http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content

Requirements 
OS X - This repo only contains the iOS implementation right now, and Xcode only runs on Mac.
New to Xcode? Download it from the Mac App Store.
Homebrew is the recommended way to install node, watchman, and flow.
brew install node. New to node or npm?
brew install --HEAD watchman. We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug.
brew install flow. If you want to use flow.


Quick start 
npm install -g react-native-cli
react-native init AwesomeProject
In the newly created folder AwesomeProject/

Open AwesomeProject.xcodeproj and hit run in Xcode
Open index.ios.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines
Hit cmd+R in your iOS simulator to reload the app and see your change!
